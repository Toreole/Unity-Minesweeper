A Minesweeper Clone made with Unity.

The project was made entirely in Unity 2018.4.17f1, but can easily be ported to other versions.

I started this because i was bored, but have now put some effort into cleaning and commenting the code.

Anyone is allowed to download and edit this project, when giving credit to this repository (similar to how CC licenses work).
